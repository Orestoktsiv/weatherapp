# weatherapp

 This weather app will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file.
Before proceeding, you'll need to sign up for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api) to access their weather data.
Save the code below in an HTML file (e.g., weather_app.html) and open it in your web browser. You can enter a city name in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button to retrieve and display the current weather information for that location.

In this example, the weather app fetches the current weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's input (city name). The retrieved weather information includes the city name, country, weather condition, and temperature in Celsius.
Replace "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY" with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. Please note that this example uses a basic API call without error handling for certain edge cases. For a production-level application, you may want to add more robust error handling and UI improvements.
Enjoy exploring and learning from this weather app! You can also extend it with more features like weather icons, forecasts, or additional weather data fields.
